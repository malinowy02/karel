Yes but you need to add some stuff to your program.
First, right after the PROGRAM ***** line, you need to add some attributes :

%NOLOCKGROUP -- because the karel program won't use motion

%NOABORT = ERROR + COMMAND -- ERROR will prevent the karel program from aborting 
if any error occur and COMMAND will prevent the user from aborting the Karel program from the TP

%NOPAUSE = ERROR + COMMAND + TPENABLE -- Same as %NOABORT, TPENABLE disable pause of the karel
 program when the TP is turned on.



Then you can add a master loop with a condition that is never satisfied to prevent your program from ending



You can even add your program the the Cold and HOT start autoexec to run the program at startup
 (i would recommend removing the COMMAND part from the %NOABORT attribute as you will need a way to move the robot once it reached the boundaries)
